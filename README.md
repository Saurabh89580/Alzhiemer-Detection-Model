# **Alzheimer’s Disease Detection Model (ResNet-18 + SHAP)**

*A hybrid research–engineering implementation for MRI-based Alzheimer’s classification.*


---

## **Overview**

This project implements a complete end-to-end deep learning pipeline for classifying structural MRI brain scans into four Alzheimer’s disease categories: Non-Demented, Very Mild Dementia, Mild Dementia, and Moderate Dementia.
The system combines a modified **SafeResNet-18** architecture with **SHAP GradientExplainer** for interpretable predictions. The backend includes preprocessing, weighted loss optimization for class imbalance, visualization modules, and model evaluation tools.

This repository contains the codebase, model training workflow, SHAP explainability utilities, and all experiment logs aligned with the methodology described in the project’s final report.

## **Abstract**

This work presents a ResNet-18–based classifier trained on the OASIS MRI dataset to detect Alzheimer’s disease severity across four classes. A weighted cross-entropy loss addresses class imbalance, and images are preprocessed to 224×224 with ImageNet standardization. SHAP GradientExplainer is integrated for model interpretability by disabling inplace ReLU operations.

The model achieves **98.90% accuracy**, **0.9787 macro precision**, **0.9954 macro recall**, and **0.9868 macro F1-score**, demonstrating strong discriminative performance across all classes. SHAP value maps provide clinically interpretable visualizations of brain regions contributing to predictions.

## **Dataset**

* **Dataset:** OASIS MRI (Kaggle mirror)
* **Total images:** 86,437
* **Classes:** 4 (Non-Demented → Moderate Dementia)
* **Train/Validation Split:** 80/20
* **Preprocessing:**

  * Resize to 248×496
  * CenterCrop to 224×224

## **Model Architecture**

The SafeResNet-18 architecture follows the ResNet-18 backbone with modifications documented on page 2 of the report:

* Initial convolution → batch normalization → ReLU → max pooling
* Four residual layers with identity shortcuts
* Global average pooling
* Linear layer producing four class logits

The architecture diagram in the report illustrates all functional blocks used in this repository’s implementation.

## **Results**

Final evaluation metrics as reported (page 5):

| Metric          | Value  |
| --------------- | ------ |
| Accuracy        | 0.9890 |
| Macro Precision | 0.9787 |
| Macro Recall    | 0.9954 |
| Macro F1-Score  | 0.9868 |
| Mean Confidence | 0.9882 |
| Validation Loss | 0.0170 |
| Training Loss   | 0.0099 |

### **Confusion Matrix Overview**

* Non-Demented: 13,271 correct
* Very Mild Dementia: 2,753 correct
* Mild Dementia: 993 correct
* Moderate Dementia: 80 correct

These values indicate strong separation across all classes with minimal confusion, as shown in the confusion matrix on pages 5–6.
